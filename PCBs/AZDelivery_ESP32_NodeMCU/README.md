# ESPuino-PCB based on AZ Delivery's ESP32 NodeMCU / Devkit C

## Features
For complete feature-list and explanations please have a look [here](https://forum.espuino.de/t/az-delivery-esp32-nodemcu-devkit-c-mit-sd-mmc-und-pn5180-als-rfid-leser/634). In the past I wrote everything in English, too, but as it turns out (surprise surprise) it's too much work.

Feel free to order this PCB yourself using the Gerber-files provided or contact me via forum (linked above).
