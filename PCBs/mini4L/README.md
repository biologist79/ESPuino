# ESPuino mini 4-Layer

This is a pcb, that was developed by myself back in 2023. It's used by hundreds of ESPuino users and fully described (in German language) [here](https://forum.espuino.de/t/espuino-mini-4layer/1661). It's successor is [ESPuino complete](https://forum.espuino.de/t/espuino-complete/3817). Kicad and Gerber files will be released soon.
It's compatible with my self-developed [LiFePO4-develboard](https://forum.espuino.de/t/esp32-develboard-d32-pro-lifepo4/1109) and [Wemos Lolin D32 pro](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d32/d32_pro.html). Pin-wise it's compatible with [Wemos Lolin D32](https://www.wemos.cc/en/latest/d32/d32.html), too - but as D32 doesn't feature PSRAM, this is useless for ESPuino.
