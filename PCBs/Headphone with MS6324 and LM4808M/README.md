# Headphone-PCB

This is a pcb, that was developed by myself. It makes use of a DAC named 'MS6324' with a LM4808M as amp. It's described in detail with pictures [here](https://forum.espuino.de/t/kopfhoererplatine-basierend-auf-ms6324-und-tda1308/1099). Please contact me via my forum in case you need one fully soldered and ready-to-use.
It's compatible with [ESPuino complete](https://forum.espuino.de/t/espuino-complete/3817) and [mini4L](https://forum.espuino.de/t/espuino-mini-4layer/1661).
